# acme.vim

[acme](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/acme/acme.html)-like mouse bindings
for vim.

## Features

* B3 actions: search forward, file opening (no compound addresses yet)
* B2 execution (partial)
* Mouse position movement using xdotool (linux only)

## TODO

* visual-mode support (B2 on selections, etc.)

## Limitations/Known bugs

* mouse movement only works reliably when there's only one window open (splits
  mess it up)
* mouse movement needs manual tweaking to work
